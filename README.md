Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm 14Kingsman, a passionate developer and tech enthusiast. Here's a little about me:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

Building an offline AI assistant for Termux, focusing on privacy and seamless local execution.

Custom APKs with stealth features, system control tools, and automation scripts.

Creating a fake-root environment ('rootbox.zip') in Termux to mimic root-like functionalities without actual root access.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

Advanced machine learning models and frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, LLaMA).

Exploring ways to enhance offline AI performance and integration on mobile devices.

Deepening my knowledge in system-level control, especially without root access.


ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:

Privacy-focused AI assistants and system management tools.

APK development with offline functionality and automation.

Projects involving offline LLM (large language model) setups and optimizations.


ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:

Optimizing performance for offline AI assistants on mobile devices.

Solving integration issues for Termux-based tools in non-root environments.

Enhancing the usability of system control scripts (e.g., eco_scan.sh) with better UI/UX.


ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:

APK modification, reverse engineering, and automation in Termux.

Setting up fully offline AI systems.

Developing custom system control toolkits without root access.

âš¡ Fun fact:
I once created a fully offline AI assistant running inside Termux on a non-rooted Android deviceâ€”it's pretty cool to see it all come together!
